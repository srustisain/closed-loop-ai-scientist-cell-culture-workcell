## 1. Organism Overview

*Vibrio natriegens* is a Gram-negative, non-pathogenic, halophilic marine bacterium originally isolated from salt marsh mud (Paynter & Bungay, 1969). It holds the record as the **fastest-growing non-pathogenic bacterium known**, with a doubling time under 10 minutes in optimal rich media.

**Why it matters for biotech:**
- Doubling time of ~9.4 min in BHIN (vs. ~20 min for *E. coli*)
- Glucose uptake rate of **3.90 g/g/h** -- more than 2x faster than *E. coli*
- **115,000 ribosomes per cell** (vs. 70,000 in *E. coli*) -- 29% RNA by dry weight
- Naturally competent (efficient transformation without electroporation)
- Growing genetic toolbox: NT-CRISPR (up to 100% efficiency), Graded-CRISPRi, Vnat Collection of standardized genetic parts
- Can consume >60 carbon substrates including chitin derivatives (ecologically relevant marine nutrient)
- Demonstrated fed-batch cultivation to >60 g/L biomass
- Two chromosomes (3.2 Mb + 1.9 Mb) with dynamic ploidy -- up to 50 copies of origin regions during fast growth

## 2. Growth Rate Records and Benchmarks

| Medium | Temp | Growth Rate (h⁻¹) | Doubling Time | Source |
|--------|------|--------------------|---------------|--------|
| BHIN (BHI + NaCl) | 37°C | **4.43** (max) | **9.4 min** | Hoffart et al. 2017 |
| BHIN (routine) | 37°C | 2.70 ± 0.03 | 15.4 min | Hoffart et al. 2017 |
| LBv2 | 37°C | ~3.0 | ~14 min | SGI/Barrick Lab |
| LB + 2.5% NaCl | 37°C | ~3.1 | 13.6 min | Pfeifer et al. 2019 |
| M9 + 1.5% NaCl + Wolfe's | 37°C | 1.70 ± 0.02 | 24 min | Long et al. 2017 |
| VN minimal + glucose (aerobic) | 37°C | 1.48-1.66 | 25-28 min | Hoffart et al. 2017 |
| Wilms-MOPS optimized | 37°C | **1.97 ± 0.13** | **21 min** | Gericke et al. 2024 |
| Low-chloride VN10 (batch) | 30°C | 0.90-0.96 | 43-46 min | Stadler et al. 2023 |
| VN minimal (anaerobic) | 37°C | 0.92 ± 0.01 | 45 min | Hoffart et al. 2017 |

**Note**: The 1.97 h⁻¹ on Wilms-MOPS medium (Gericke et al. 2024) is the **highest growth rate ever reported on a chemically defined medium** for *V. natriegens*. This was achieved by independently optimizing NaCl and osmolality -- two parameters previously confounded in the literature.

**OD600 to dry weight**: 1.0 OD600 ≈ **0.27 g CDW/L** (*V. natriegens* specific)

## 3. Media Composition

### 3.1 Complex Media Formulations

**BHIN** (Hoffart et al. 2017) -- Fastest growth:

- Plus trace: KBr, SrCl₂, H₃BO₃, NaSiO₃, NaF, NH₄NO₃, Na₂HPO₄

### 3.2 Defined/Minimal Media

**VN Minimal Medium** (Hoffart et al. 2017):

| Component | Concentration |
|-----------|---------------|
| (NH₄)₂SO₄ | 5 g/L |
| NaCl | 15 g/L |
| KH₂PO₄ | 1 g/L |
| K₂HPO₄ | 1 g/L |
| MgSO₄ | 0.25 g/L |
| CaCl₂ | 0.01 g/L |
| FeSO₄·7H₂O | 16.4 mg/L |
| MnSO₄·H₂O | 10 mg/L |
| CuSO₄·5H₂O | 0.3 mg/L |
| ZnSO₄·7H₂O | 1 mg/L |
| NiCl₂·6H₂O | 0.02 mg/L |
| Glucose | 10-50 g/L |

Growth rate: 1.48-1.66 h⁻¹ (aerobic), 0.92 h⁻¹ (anaerobic)

**M9-based Semi-Defined** (Long et al. 2017):
- Standard M9 salts + 15 g/L NaCl
- 10 mL/L Wolfe's minerals + 10 mL/L Wolfe's vitamins
- 0.05 g/L yeast extract (eliminates lag phase)
- Growth rate: 1.70 ± 0.02 h⁻¹

**Wilms-MOPS Optimized** (Gericke et al. 2024):
- MOPS buffer: 280-350 mM (optimal)
- NaCl: 7.5-15 g/L
- Trace elements, glucose 10-20 g/L
- Growth rate: **1.97 ± 0.13 h⁻¹** (record on defined medium)

### 3.3 Low-Chloride Industrial Medium

**VN10 Medium** (Stadler et al. 2023) -- eliminates bioreactor corrosion:

| Component | Concentration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Glucose | 24 g/L |
| KH₂PO₄ | 3 g/L |
| Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O | 16.59 g/L |
| Na₂SO₄ | 8.10 g/L |
| Na₃-citrate·2H₂O | 9.84 g/L |
| MgSO₄·7H₂O | 0.74 g/L |
| NH₄Cl | 1 g/L |
| Trace elements | 2% (v/v) |

**Key results:**
- Chloride reduced from 12.65 g/L to **10.3 mg/L** (>1000-fold)
- Shake flask OD600: 20.8 ± 0.87
- Fed-batch bioreactor: **59-62.5 g/L CDW**
- Osmolality: 0.8-0.91 Osmol/kg

**Critical findings:**
- EDTA-containing trace element solutions **strongly inhibit** growth
- Citrate is essential -- prevents ammonium magnesium phosphate precipitate while serving as sodium source
- NaCl can be **fully replaced** by Na₂HPO₄ + Na₂SO₄ + Na₃-citrate at equivalent total Na⁺

### 3.4 v2 Salts Explained

The v2 salt supplement (developed by SGI-DNA for Vmax product line):

| Component | Concentration |
|-----------|---------------|
| NaCl | 204 mM (11.9 g/L) |
| KCl | 4.2 mM (0.31 g/L) |
| MgCl₂ | 23.14 mM (2.2 g/L) |

**Why v2 outperforms simple NaCl supplementation:** K⁺ and Mg²⁺ are essential for ribosome stability and translation fidelity. Cell-free extracts from LBv2-grown cells produce **196 ± 12.46 µg/mL** protein, outperforming LB3 extracts (Des Soye et al. 2018). Since *V. natriegens* has 29% RNA by dry weight (higher ribosome content than *E. coli*), its Mg²⁺ and K⁺ demands are proportionally higher.

---

## 4. Sodium and Salt Requirements

NaCl is the **single most critical parameter** for *V. natriegens* growth, but recent work has overturned long-standing assumptions.

### Classical Understanding (pre-2024)
- Optimal: 15-25 g/L NaCl (1.5-2.5%)
- Minimum: ~10-15 g/L for growth
- Below 5 g/L: almost no growth
- Above 58 g/L (1M): no growth
- Best in LB: 2.5% NaCl gave highest OD of 1.021 (Pfeifer et al. 2019)

### Revised Understanding (Gericke et al. 2024)
- **Global optimum: 7.5-15 g/L NaCl** -- lower than previously thought
- The classical 15-25 g/L "optimum" was confounded by osmolality effects
- When osmolality is independently controlled via MOPS buffer, optimal NaCl drops significantly
- Growth rate at 10 g/L NaCl + 280 mM MOPS: **1.97 h⁻¹** (highest on defined medium)
- **Sodium ions are specifically required** (not just osmolarity) -- they stabilize the membrane and drive Na⁺-dependent transport

### Sodium Source Flexibility
- NaCl replaceable with Na₂HPO₄, Na₂SO₄, Na₃-citrate at equivalent total Na⁺ (Stadler et al. 2023)
- Total Na⁺ concentration is what matters, not the specific anion
- This enables low-chloride industrial processes

### Compatible Solutes as Sodium Supplements
- Glycine betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine serve **dual roles**: osmoprotectant AND carbon/energy source
- Choline, glycine betaine, DMG, and DMSP are most effective at rescuing growth at low Na⁺ (recent 2025 finding)

---

## 5. Osmolality

This is a recently recognized critical parameter, previously confounded with NaCl effects.

| Osmolality (Osmol/kg) | Effect |
|------------------------|--------|
| 0.6-0.8 | Suboptimal growth |
| **1.0-1.6** | **Optimal range** |
| 1.0-1.4 | Optimal at pH 8.0 |
| 1.1-1.5 | Optimal at pH 7.5 |
| >2.0 | Growth impaired |

**Key insight:** Previously reported NaCl "optima" of 15-25 g/L were partly an osmolality artifact. When osmolality is maintained independently (via MOPS buffer), the true sodium optimum is lower. This means *V. natriegens* needs both: (1) specific sodium ions and (2) appropriate osmolality from any compatible solute.

At lowest tested osmolality (0.88 Osmol/kg, 200 mM MOPS, 0 g/L NaCl): growth rate only 0.81 h⁻¹. At optimized osmolality (1.2 Osmol/kg): up to 1.97 h⁻¹ and final OD up to 13.

---

## 6. pH and Buffering

### pH Range
| pH | Effect |
|----|--------|
| 5.5 | Virtually no growth |
| 6.0-6.5 | Poor to moderate |
| **7.0-8.5** | **Optimal** |
| 8.0 | Recommended initial pH for mineral media |
| 9.0-10.0 | Reduced but viable |

### Acid Sensitivity -- The #1 Growth Limitation

This is arguably the most important and underappreciated factor in *V. natriegens* cultivation:

- *V. natriegens* **lacks nearly all acid resistance mechanisms** present in *E. coli* (no glutamate-dependent, arginine-dependent, or lysine-dependent acid resistance systems)
- In unbuffered glucose fermentation, pH drops to ~5.3 from organic acid accumulation
- The organism reaches **extinction within 12 hours** after growth phase -- 3 days sooner than *E. coli*
- Up to 25% of carbon flux goes to acetate, plus lactate and formate under microaerobic conditions

### Buffering Requirements

| Glucose (g/L) | Minimum MOPS | Recommended MOPS |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| 10 | 180 mM | 180-300 mM |
| 20 | 300 mM | **450 mM** |
| Unbuffered | -- | Death within 12 h |

- 100 mM MOPS delays extinction by 24 h
- 200 mM MOPS prevents extinction over 100 h
- **450 mM MOPS at 10 g/L NaCl** recommended for time-efficient production (Gericke et al. 2024)
- MOPS preferred over phosphate buffer (doesn't interfere with phosphate metabolism)

---

## 7. Temperature

| Temperature | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| ≤28°C | Significantly slowed; **avoid for routine work** |
| 30°C | Good growth; **preferred for fed-batch** (62% more biomass than 37°C) |
| **37°C** | **Maximum growth rate** |
| >37°C | Growth slows significantly |

**Critical nuance:** 37°C gives the fastest instantaneous growth rate, but 30°C gives higher final biomass in fed-batch. This is because lower temperature reduces overflow metabolism and acid accumulation. The choice depends on your objective: growth rate vs. biomass yield.

**Starter cultures**: Commonly grown overnight at 30°C, 225 rpm.

---

## 8. Oxygen and Aeration

*V. natriegens* has **exceptionally high oxygen demand** -- this is the rate-limiting factor in 96-well plates.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Specific O₂ uptake rate | 22-28 mmol/gCDW/h |
| Volumetric OUR (fed-batch peak) | Up to **500 mmol/L/h** |
| DO setpoint (bioreactor) | ≥30-40% saturation |
| Bioreactor aeration | 0.25-2 vvm + up to 60% O₂ enrichment |
| Bioreactor agitation | 500-1200 rpm (cascade) |

**Consequence of O₂ limitation:** Triggers mixed acid fermentation → acetate, lactate, formate accumulate → pH crash → rapid cell death (due to acid sensitivity).

**Plate-based cultivation:**
- BioLector XT with FlowerPlate MTPs: 582 rpm, 1 mm amplitude works well
- Standard 96-well: use **low fill volumes** (100-200 µL), high shaking speed, breathable membrane seals
- Measurement interval: every 5-10 min given fast doubling time

---

## 9. Carbon Sources

### Growth Rates by Carbon Source (VN minimal, aerobic, 37°C)

| Carbon Source | Growth Rate (h⁻¹) | Doubling Time | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Sucrose** | **1.79 ± 0.02** | 23.2 min | Best single carbon source |
| **N-acetylglucosamine** | **1.74 ± 0.01** | 23.9 min | Chitin monomer -- ecologically relevant |
| **Glucose** | **1.68 ± 0.02** | 24.8 min | Most commonly used |
| Fructose | 1.51 ± 0.08 | 27.5 min | |
| Maltose | 1.22 ± 0.01 | 34.1 min | |
| Glycerol | 0.86 ± 0.03 | 48.3 min | Lower overflow metabolism |
| Arabinose | 0.83 ± 0.02 | 50.1 min | |
| Glucosamine | 0.68 ± 0.02 | 61.2 min | |
| Rhamnose | 0.40 ± 0.01 | 104 min | |
| Galactose | 0.18 ± 0.01 | 231 min | Very slow |

**No growth on:** xylose, lactose, mannose, cellobiose, ethanol, methanol, formate (wild-type).

Source: Hoffart et al. 2017

### Substrate Uptake Rates
- **Aerobic glucose uptake**: 3.90 ± 0.08 g/g CDW/h (21.4 ± 1.3 mmol/gDW/h)
- **Anaerobic glucose uptake**: 7.81 ± 0.71 g/g CDW/h
- **Biomass yield**: 0.38-0.44 gDW/g glucose (aerobic)
- For comparison, *E. coli* aerobic glucose uptake is ~1.5-2.0 g/g/h

### Key Finding: Sucrose > Glucose
Sucrose gives ~7% higher growth rate than glucose. This is underexplored in the optimization literature and could be a quick win for BO.

### Seawater-Based Cultivation
- Seawater naturally provides ~3% NaCl plus trace minerals
- Growth in seawater-based VN medium was **better** than distilled water-based (Dong et al. 2022)
- No external NaCl needed; trace minerals from seawater contribute positively

---

## 10. Nitrogen Sources and Amino Acids

### Primary Nitrogen Source
- Standard: **(NH₄)₂SO₄ at 5 g/L** in VN minimal medium
- Fed-batch: NH₄Cl at 1 g/L (VN10 medium)
- Generally non-limiting in standard formulations

### Nitrogen Fixation
- *V. natriegens* possesses nif cluster genes
- Can fix atmospheric N₂ under nitrogen-limiting **anaerobic** conditions
- Not relevant for aerobic optimization but interesting biologically

### Amino Acid Supplementation

**Yeast extract:**
- 0.05 g/L in M9-based medium eliminates lag phase
- Provides vitamins, cofactors, and growth factors

**Casamino acids (CAA):**
- Low concentrations show strong positive influence on growth
- Provides free amino acids that bypass biosynthetic cost

**Aspartate and glutamate:**
- Positively influence growth
- Provide pH buffering (amino acid catabolism can release NH₃)
- Aspartate may serve as alternative energy source and protective osmolyte
- *V. natriegens* has elevated glutamate/glutamine levels compared to *E. coli*

### Biomass Composition (Long et al. 2017)
- **Protein: 47%** of dry weight
- **RNA: 29%** (very high -- reflects massive ribosome content)
- Lipids: 7%
- Glycogen: remaining

The 47% protein content and extreme growth rate imply massive amino acid biosynthetic demand. Amino acid supplementation could relieve this bottleneck.

---

## 11. Divalent Cations

### Magnesium (Mg²⁺)

| Context | Mg²⁺ Source | Concentration |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| v2 salts | MgCl₂ | 23.14 mM (2.2 g/L) |
| VN minimal | MgSO₄ | ~2 mM (0.25 g/L) |
| VN10 low-chloride | MgSO₄·7H₂O | ~3 mM (0.74 g/L) |
| Cell-free (Des Soye) | Mg-glutamate | 3.5 mM |
| Cell-free (Failmezger) | Mg-glutamate | 18 mM |

Mg²⁺ is critical for ribosome stability. Given *V. natriegens* has 29% RNA by dry weight (vs. 21% for *E. coli*), its Mg²⁺ demand is proportionally higher. The wide range in cell-free Mg²⁺ optima (3.5 vs 18 mM) suggests this parameter is highly context-dependent.

### Potassium (K⁺)

| Context | K⁺ Source | Concentration |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| v2 salts | KCl | 4.2 mM |
| VN minimal | KH₂PO₄ + K₂HPO₄ | ~14.7 mM total |
| Cell-free | K-glutamate | 80-160 mM |
| VN10 | KH₂PO₄ | 22 mM |

K⁺ is important for translation fidelity and ribosome function.

### Calcium (Ca²⁺)

| Context | Ca²⁺ Source | Concentration |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| VN minimal | CaCl₂ | ~90 µM (0.01 g/L) |
| VN10 trace | CaCl₂·2H₂O | ~183 µM |

---

## 12. Trace Metals

Trace metals have a **"very strong influence"** on *V. natriegens* growth (Pfeifer et al. 2019).

### Standard Trace Element Concentrations

| Metal | VN Minimal | VN10 Trace (final) | Wolfe's Minerals (final) |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ | 59 µM (FeSO₄) | ~118 µM (FeSO₄) | ~3.6 µM (FeSO₄) |
| Mn²⁺ | 59 µM (MnSO₄) | ~118 µM (MnSO₄) | ~30 µM (MnSO₄) |
| Zn²⁺ | 3.5 µM (ZnSO₄) | ~7 µM (ZnSO₄) | ~3.5 µM (ZnSO₄) |
| Cu²⁺ | 1.2 µM (CuSO₄) | ~2.4 µM (CuSO₄) | - |
| Ni²⁺ | 0.08 µM (NiCl₂) | ~0.16 µM (NiCl₂) | ~0.8 µM (NiCl₂) |

### Critical Finding: EDTA Inhibits Growth
EDTA-containing trace element solutions **strongly inhibit** *V. natriegens* growth, even though EDTA is commonly used as a chelator in bacterial media. **Citrate is the preferred chelator** -- it keeps metals bioavailable while preventing precipitation (Stadler et al. 2023).

### Iron is Likely the Most Important Trace Metal
- *V. natriegens* can use iron and manganese oxides as electron acceptors anaerobically (extracellular electron transfer)
- Iron speciation matters: ferric citrate (0.1 g/L) is used in Marine 2216E medium
- Siderophore production is expected given marine origin (iron-limited marine environment)
- Wide variation in iron concentrations across formulations (3.6-118 µM) suggests this is underoptimized

---

## 13. Overflow Metabolism and Acid Sensitivity

This is the **central challenge** of *V. natriegens* cultivation and the most important factor for BO to address.

### The Problem
- Even under fully aerobic conditions with excess O₂, *V. natriegens* produces **0.8 mol acetate per mol glucose** consumed (Long et al. 2017)
- Up to 25% of carbon flux goes to acetate via the Pta-AckA pathway
- Additional byproducts under microaerobic conditions: succinate, formate, lactate, ethanol
- After glucose depletion, cells undergo an "acetate switch" -- upregulating ACS to re-assimilate acetate

### Why This Kills Cells
- *V. natriegens* lacks acid resistance mechanisms (no GAD, ADI, or CAD systems found in *E. coli*)
- pH drops to ~5.3 in unbuffered batch culture
- Cells reach **extinction within 12 hours** after growth phase
- *E. coli* survives 3 days longer under identical conditions

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Heavy buffering**: 300-450 mM MOPS (see Section 6)
2. **Fed-batch glucose limitation**: Prevents overflow metabolism entirely
3. **Lower temperature**: 30°C reduces overflow vs. 37°C
4. **Carbon source engineering**: Glycerol produces less overflow than glucose
5. **Mixed carbon sources**: Glucose + glycerol blends could reduce peak acid production
6. **Slow-release carbon**: Enzymatic release (sucrose + invertase) could mimic fed-batch in plates

---

## 14. Unique Biology

### Two Chromosomes and Dynamic Ploidy
- Bipartite genome: Chr1 (3.2 Mb, 11 rRNA operons, ~103 tRNAs) + Chr2 (1.9 Mb, 1 rRNA operon, ~21 tRNAs)
- Origin copy numbers swing from **~50 copies in early exponential** to ~20 in mid-exponential to near-diploid in stationary phase
- This creates a **6-fold gene dosage asymmetry** near origins during fast growth
- A rationally designed chromosome fusion did NOT prevent rapid growth (Messerschmidt et al. 2024)

**Implication for BO:** The growth phase at which cells are harvested/measured matters enormously for any gene expression work. BO could optimize inoculation density and harvest time to exploit ploidy dynamics.

### Quorum Sensing
- Harveyi-type QS system (LuxR/HapR homologues)
- Controls EPS production, biofilm formation, metabolic shifts at high cell density
- QS-regulated CpsR controls exopolysaccharide production (up to 157 ± 20 mg/L EPS, causing 800-fold viscosity increase)

### Electroactivity
- Direct electron transfer to electrodes: 6.6 µA/cm²
- Mediated electron transfer: 196 µA/cm²
- Hybrid extracellular electron transfer pathway
- Can use iron and manganese oxides as terminal electron acceptors

### Catalase Activity
- Minimal/low compared to *E. coli* (Pfeifer et al. 2019)
- May explain sensitivity to oxidative stress during competence
- Overexpression of AhpCF increased viability by >15.7-fold

---

## 15. Novel Optimization Ideas

### 15.1 Parameters from Existing Literature (Underexplored)

**Glycine betaine as dual-function supplement** (0-10 mM):
- Acts as both osmoprotectant AND carbon/energy source
- Choline, betaine, DMG, and DMSP rescue growth at low Na⁺
- Largely unexplored as a deliberate growth optimization supplement
- Source: recent 2025 *Appl. Environ. Microbiol.* study

**Iron speciation optimization:**
- FeCl₃ vs. ferric citrate vs. FeSO₄ -- different bioavailability
- Citrate-complexed iron remains bioavailable; EDTA-complexed does not
- Iron has "very strong influence" on growth but optimal form/concentration is undercharacterized
- Consider siderophore supplementation (marine organism adapted to iron-limited environment)

**Sucrose instead of glucose:**
- 7% higher growth rate (1.79 vs 1.68 h⁻¹) -- a free improvement
- Underused in the field; most labs default to glucose

**N-acetylglucosamine (chitin monomer):**
- Nearly as fast as glucose (1.74 h⁻¹), ecologically natural substrate
- Could be explored as primary or supplemental carbon source

### 15.2 Novel Protocol-Level Parameters

**Seed culture growth phase at inoculation:**
- Ploidy varies 6-fold between early and late exponential phase
- Inoculating from early exponential (high ploidy, more ribosomes) vs. stationary phase could affect lag time and initial growth rate
- BO could optimize the OD at which seed culture is harvested

**Temperature shift protocol:**
- Start at 30°C (ribosome accumulation phase, less overflow metabolism)
- Shift to 37°C at specific OD (growth burst phase)
- Analogous to "carb-loading" -- accumulate biosynthetic machinery before maximizing growth
- Achievable in plate reader by moving plates between incubators

**Carbon source blending:**
- Glucose:glycerol ratios from 0:1 to 1:0
- Glycerol produces less overflow metabolism than glucose
- Mixed sources could prevent peak acid production while maintaining reasonable growth rate
- Sucrose + invertase co-addition for enzymatic slow-release (mimics fed-batch in 96-well)

**Fill volume in 96-well plates:**
- 50-250 µL range directly controls kₗa (oxygen transfer)
- Lower volume = better aeration but more evaporation
- Interaction with shaking speed and seal type

**Shaking intermittency:**
- Continuous vs. periodic (5 min on / 5 min off)
- Brief pauses may allow surface oxygen access via pellicle
- Periodic O₂ oscillations produce synchronized growth dynamics (RSC 2025)

**Conditioned medium fraction:**
- Add 0-30% spent medium from stationary-phase *V. natriegens*
- Contains autoinducers, quorum sensing molecules, secreted growth factors
- Could prime fresh cultures for faster growth initiation

### 15.3 Chemical Additives (Novel)

**Sub-inhibitory surfactants:**
- Tween-20, Tween-80, or Triton X-100 at 0.001-0.1%
- Increase membrane permeability → faster nutrient uptake
- *V. natriegens* MK3 naturally produces biosurfactants
- Overexpression of D,D-carboxypeptidase PBP5/6 caused 2.8x increase in outer membrane permeability

**Redox mediators:**
- Riboflavin (0-50 µM), methylene blue, neutral red
- *V. natriegens* is electroactive -- redox mediators could alter intracellular redox balance
- Almost entirely unexplored for growth optimization (vs. electricity generation)

**QS modulators:**
- Exogenous AI-2 autoinducer (or synthetic DPD) to manipulate density-dependent behavior
- QS inhibitors (furanone derivatives) to delay stationary phase entry and extend exponential growth
- Could decouple growth phase from actual cell density

**Amino acid cocktails:**
- Aspartate + glutamate (pH buffering + energy source)
- Specific amino acids that bypass expensive biosynthetic pathways
- Target the 47% protein content bottleneck

### 15.4 Advanced Biological Approaches

**Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE):**
- Successfully applied: 89% growth rate increase on acetate (2025)
- ALE on raffinose generated efficient utilization (2024)
- Convergent oxyR mutations under oxidative stress (2020)
- Short-term ALE pre-conditioning (10-20 generations) in target medium could shift baseline before BO optimization
- Could BO-optimize ALE conditions themselves (transfer frequency, selection pressure)

**Conditioned medium / cross-feeding:**
- *V. natriegens* produces indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at ~10 nM
- Tested in co-culture with *Euglena gracilis* (>20% biomass increase for algae)
- Self-conditioning: add back filtered spent medium at various ratios

## 16. Bayesian Optimization Methodology

### 16.1 Key Papers for BO in Microbial Growth

| Paper | Organism | Parameters | Improvement | Key Method |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Lapierre 2025 | *S. pasteurii* | 21 media components | **+28% biomass** over DoE | Batch BO, RoboLector |
| Nature Comms 2025 | PBMCs, yeast | 4-9 factors | **10-30x fewer** experiments vs DoE | GP + categorical overlap kernel |
| Cosenza 2022 | C2C12 cells | 14 components | **+181% cells**, 38% fewer experiments | Multi-information source BO |
| CETCH 2022 | In vitro pathway | 27 enzymes | **10x productivity** in 1000 assays | Active learning, 8 rounds |
| *P. putida* 2025 | *P. putida* | 48 media components | +60-70% titer, +350% yield | ML + explainable AI |

### 16.2 Practical Configuration

**GP Kernel:** Matern 5/2 (slightly less smooth than RBF, more realistic for biology)

**Acquisition Function:**
- **Thompson Sampling** for initial rounds: hyperparameter-free, naturally balances exploration/exploitation, robust with sparse data
- Switch to **logEI** or **UCB** with more data
- For batch suggestions: Thompson Sampling naturally provides diverse batches

**Initial Design:**
- Allocate ~50% of total experiment budget to initial space-filling design
- Latin hypercube sampling or Sobol sequences
- Length scale priors: 1/4 to 1/2 of each parameter's total range

**Handling Noise in 96-Well Plates:**
- GP noise model handles biological + pipetting variability naturally
- **Against routine replication**: "such replication may represent a missed opportunity to extract maximal information about the response surface" (Siska et al. 2025)
- Randomize well positions to mitigate edge effects (temperature gradients, evaporation)
- Model positional bias explicitly if needed

**Objective Function Options:**
1. **Maximum OD600** -- simplest, directly from plate reader
2. **Growth rate (µ_max)** -- more informative, requires curve fitting
3. **Lag time** -- important for fast-turnaround applications
4. **Multi-objective Pareto**: growth rate vs. final OD vs. lag time (use qEHVI in BoTorch)
5. **Composite score**: weighted µ_max + final OD + R² of growth curve fit

**Recommended objective for your project:** Multi-objective with growth rate (µ_max) and final OD600 as primary objectives. These can trade off (e.g., high glucose → fast growth but acid crash → low final OD).

### 16.3 Growth Curve Analysis

Use **GP-based growth curve fitting** (AMiGA software) rather than simple max-OD:
- Handles non-standard curve shapes
- Explicitly accounts for experimental noise
- Extracts µ_max, lag time, carrying capacity from kinetic data
- Superior to traditional logistic curve fitting for fast-growing organisms

### 16.4 Software Tools

| Tool | Best For | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **BayBE** (Merck) | Practitioner-friendly, built-in chemical encodings | Transfer learning, mixed continuous/categorical, multi-objective; designed for self-driving labs |
| **BoTorch/GPyTorch** (Meta) | Full flexibility, custom acquisition functions | Most published bioprocess papers use this |
| **scikit-optimize** | Quick prototyping | Used in several bio papers |
| **AMiGA** | Growth curve analysis from plate readers | GP-based, directly applicable to OD kinetic data |
| **SAASBO** (BoTorch) | High-dimensional (>10 params) | Discovers which dimensions actually matter via sparse subspaces |

**Recommendation:** BayBE for the main BO loop (built-in support for mixed parameters, batch suggestions, transfer learning). AMiGA for extracting growth metrics from plate reader data as objective function inputs.

### 16.5 Experiment Budget

Based on published precedent:
- Most successful papers converge in **4-8 rounds**
- With 96 wells: run 32-48 unique conditions per plate (2-3 replicates) or up to 96 unique (no replicates)
- The literature suggests **replicates are often not worth the opportunity cost** when GP provides uncertainty estimates
- Budget for **5-10 plates total** (480-960 unique conditions)
- *V. natriegens* doubling time of ~10 min means a full growth curve in **3-6 hours** -- enables **multiple BO rounds per day**

## 17. Recommended BO Parameter Space

### Tier 1 -- Highest Impact (include in every experiment)

| Parameter | Range | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **NaCl concentration** | 5-25 g/L | Most critical; true optimum (7.5-15 g/L) is lower than classical literature |
| **MOPS buffer concentration** | 100-500 mM | Prevents acid death; interacts with osmolality |
| **Initial pH** | 7.0-8.5 | Interacts with buffer and overflow metabolism |
| **Temperature** | 30-37°C | Growth rate vs. biomass yield trade-off |
| **Carbon source concentration** | 5-30 g/L glucose (or sucrose) | Drives overflow metabolism at high concentrations |

### Tier 2 -- High Impact (include if dimensionality allows)

| Parameter | Range | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **MgCl₂ / MgSO₄** | 0.5-25 mM | Ribosome stability; v2 salts use 23 mM |
| **Casamino acids** | 0-5 g/L | Relieve amino acid biosynthetic burden |
| **Fill volume** (96-well) | 50-250 µL | Controls oxygen transfer directly |
| **Glycine betaine** | 0-10 mM | Novel dual osmoprotectant + carbon source |
| **FeCl₃ / ferric citrate** | 0-200 µM | "Very strong influence"; underoptimized |

### Tier 3 -- Exploratory (for later rounds or high-dimensional BO)

| Parameter | Range | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| KCl | 0-10 mM | Required ion; interact with Na⁺ |
| Yeast extract | 0-2 g/L | Vitamins/cofactors; eliminates lag |
| Aspartate / glutamate | 0-5 g/L | pH buffering + growth enhancement |
| Glucose:glycerol ratio | 0:1 to 1:0 | Overflow metabolism management |
| Seed culture OD | 0.1-2.0 | Exploits ploidy dynamics |
| Tween-80 | 0-0.05% | Membrane permeability; novel |
| Shaking speed/pattern | Variable | Oxygen dynamics |
| Conditioned medium | 0-30% | QS priming; novel |
| Carbon source identity | Glucose/sucrose/GlcNAc | Categorical; sucrose may be best |

### Key Interactions to Capture
- **NaCl × MOPS** (sodium vs. osmolality -- the confound that fooled the field)
- **NaCl × temperature** (salt tolerance is temperature-dependent)
- **Carbon source × MOPS** (glucose → acid → pH crash if underbuffered)
- **NaCl × MgCl₂** (divalent cation interactions)
- **Fill volume × carbon concentration** (O₂ demand scales with growth rate)

### Suggested Starting Point: 7-Parameter Design

For the first BO round (Weekend 1-2), start with these 7 parameters as a balanced exploration:

1. NaCl (5-25 g/L)
2. MOPS (100-500 mM)
3. Initial pH (7.0-8.5)
4. Glucose (5-30 g/L)
5. MgSO₄ (0.5-25 mM)
6. Fill volume (75-250 µL)
7. Casamino acids (0-5 g/L)

Use Latin hypercube sampling for initial plate, then BO-guided suggestions for subsequent plates. Temperature fixed at 37°C initially (optimize later if needed).
