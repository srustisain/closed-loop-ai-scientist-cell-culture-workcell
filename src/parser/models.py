"""
Data models for the parser component.

These Pydantic models define the contracts between the data parser and the
rest of the system (experiment designer, Bayesian optimizer, webapp).

Terminology
-----------
- **Well**: A single position in a 96-well plate where cells grow.
- **OD600 (Optical Density at 600nm)**: A measurement of how much light passes
  through the cell suspension. Higher OD = more cells. This is the standard
  proxy for cell density.

Growth Metrics
--------------
The parser computes the following values per well from the OD600 time series:

- **growth_rate** (1/hour): The specific growth rate (mu) during exponential
  phase. Cells in exponential phase follow OD(t) = OD_0 * e^(mu*t). We compute
  mu by fitting a linear regression to ln(OD) vs time -- the slope is mu.
  **This is the primary optimization target**: higher growth_rate = faster
  cell division = what the Bayesian optimizer maximizes.

- **doubling_time_hours** (hours): How long it takes the cell population to
  double. Calculated as ln(2) / growth_rate. This is a more intuitive way to
  express the same information -- a doubling time of 2h means faster growth
  than 4h. Useful for sanity-checking against known literature values.

- **r_squared** (0 to 1): Coefficient of determination for the exponential
  fit. Measures how well the exponential model explains the observed data.
  Values above ~0.95 indicate a reliable growth rate estimate. Low values
  suggest the well may not have entered proper exponential growth, or the
  data window includes lag/stationary phase. This is a **data quality
  indicator** -- it flags unreliable wells so the optimizer can down-weight
  or exclude them.

- **max_od** (float): The highest OD600 reading observed during the valid
  data window. Represents the peak cell density achieved in the well.
  **Second optimization target** for multi-objective BO: higher max_od =
  more total biomass produced. Can trade off against growth_rate (e.g.,
  high glucose may give fast initial growth but acid crash lowers final OD).
